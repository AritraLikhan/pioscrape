# Scrape Facebook posts and links

A basic library for scraping Facebook post texts and referencing links

# Special Feature

Facebook uses dynamic loading contents which are hard to scrape using most existing scraping tools;
Pioscraper is an exception to this and allows the user to dynamically load as many posts as needed 
and have them scraped. 

## Running the appilcation

### From node library collection

1. Install Node.js in your system if not installed yet.
2. Install pioscrper using

```bash
npm i pioscraper
```
3. Create a new file "script.js" in the same directory and copy-paste this repo's "script.js" code
   into that.
4. Edit the code using your own Facebook email,password,desired page/profile link and number of posts
   you wanna scrape.
5. Run "script.js" using

```bash
node script.js
```

## Warning

While scraping publicly available data sounds legal, Facebook has strict policies against web scraping, 
unethical use of the tool, therefore, is strongly discouraged.
